# Speaker-Diarization

speaker diarization (SD) method is a speech signal, without any accompanying supervised knowledge concerning the speakers who are involved. The goal of a SD system is to:


• Estimate the number of speakers.


• Estimate the boundaries of speaker-homogeneous segments.


• Map each segment to a speaker ID.
